def apply_air_density_adjustment(wind_speed, pressure, temperature, height=0):
    """
    Applies air density corrections to the wind speed values following suggestions by the IEC 61400-12-1:2017 [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    wind_speed : float or array-like
        The wind speed values in m/s.                                                           
    pressure : float or array-like
        Air preassure in Pa.
    temperature : float or array-like
        Air temperature in degree Celsius.
    height : float or array-like, optional
        The (hub) height of that the air density is going to be adjusted to in m, by default 0

    Returns
    -------
    numeric or array-like
        The air density corrected wind speed in m/s at the given height.

    Notes
    ------
        Ideal gas equation applied since it is nearly equivalent to a real-gas equation at humidity = 0, and humidity does not have a significant impact until high temperatures are considered.
        Pressure projection using barometric equation and density correction from assuming equal energy in the wind.
