## Simulation for a single turbine

    """
    Perform simple windpower simulation for a single turbine. Can also project to a hubheight before
    simulating.

    Notes:
        * In order to project to a hub height, the measuredHeight, hubHeight and either roughness or 
          alpha must be provided
            - weather.windutil.roughnessFromCLC, .roughnessFromGWA, and .alphaFromGWA can help 
              provide these factors
        * If no projection factors are given, windspeeds are assumed to already be at the desired 
          hub height
    Inputs:
        windspeed - np-array, list of np-arrays, pd-Series, or pd-DataFrame
            * Time series of measured wind speeds

        powerCurve 
            [ (float, float), ... ]
                * An array of "wind speed" to "power output" pairs, as two-member tuples, maping the 
                  power profile of the turbine to be simulated
                * The powerCurve pairs must contain the boundary benhavior:
                    - The first (after sorting by wind speed) pair will be used as the 
                      "cut in"
                    - The last (after sorting) pair will be used as the "cut out" 
                    - The maximal pair will be used as the rated speed
            str
                * An identifier from the TurbineLibrary dictionary

        measuredHeight - float, or list of floats matching the number of wind speed time series
            * The height (in meters) where the wind speeds were measured 

        roughness - float, or list of floats matching the number of wind speed time series
            * The roughness length of the area associated with the measured wind speeds
            ! Providing this input instructs the res.weather.windutil.projectByLogLaw function
            ! Cannot be used in conjunction with 'alpha'
    
        alpha - float, or list of floats matching the number of wind speed time series
            * The alpha value of the area associated with the measured wind speeds
            ! Providing this input instructs the res.weather.windutil.projectByPowerLaw function
    
        hubHeight - float, or list of floats matching the number of wind speed time series
            * The hub height (in meters) of the wind turbine to simulate

        loss - float
            * A constant loss rate to apply to the simulated turbine(s)

        capacity - floar
            * The maximal capacity of the turbine being simulated
            * If 'None' is given, then the following occurs:
                - When performance is the name of a turbine, the capacity is read from the TurbineLibrary
                - When the performance is a list of windspeed-power_output pairs, then the capacity is 
                  taken as the maximum power output
    
    Returns: ( performance, hub-wind-speeds )
        performance - A numpy array of performance values
        hub-wind-speeds - The projected wind speeds at the turbine's hub height
